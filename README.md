# Password Generator

## Description
In this project we have been given a starter code to a random password generator. However, the button was not working properly. The challenge was to add in a prompt when the button was pressed and have the user answer a few questions about the length of the password and password criteria. After all the questions have been answered, a random password will be generated.
